 Problem statement

 Merge sort is a classic divide and conquer algorithm that recursively divides an input array in two halves, sorts each half, then merges those two halves. Write a method that accepts two sorted arrays, merges them and returns a new globally sorted array, comprised of all elements of the input arrays.

 Constraints and Assumptions

 Both input arrays will be sorted in ascending order.
 Try to shoot for linear time complexity.

 Examples

 mergeSorted([2,5,7,8,9],[9]) -> [2,5,7,8,9,9]
 mergeSorted([7,8],[1,2]) -> [1,2,7,8]
 mergeSorted([2],[]) -> [2]
